# Copilot Game Additions Log

## December 8, 2025

Added the following games and their logic:
- Game5: Memory Card game (classic match pairs)
- Game6: Tic-Tac-Toe (2 player)
- Game7: Rock Paper Scissors (vs computer)
- Game8: Hangman (guess the word)
- Game9: Minesweeper (simple grid)
- Game10: War Card Game (compare cards)
- Game11: Blackjack Card Game (player vs dealer)

Snake and Simon Says were swapped for War and Blackjack card games as requested.

Each game is implemented in its own folder with a single React component, using simple logic and modern UI styles. All games are playable instantly, no downloads required.

- Planned: Add 2-player and 1-player modes to TicTacToe and other games. Will update game logic and UI to allow switching between modes.
- Next steps: Implement mode selection and AI logic for 1-player mode, then apply to other games as needed.

(Work in progress, will continue when you return!)
